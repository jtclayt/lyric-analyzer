  This is the index.html page for my CP3 webpage. The page uses the lyrics.ovh API to get song
  lyrics requested by a user. The lyrics are broken down into individual words and analyzed for
  uniqueness. The unique word use of each artist is compared based on percent of total words that
  are unique using a D3 bar chart. I learned how to use D3 for a work project using the
  Udemy tutorial: https://www.udemy.com/course/masteringd3js/.

        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>
          This website uses the lyrics.ovh API to do some simple analysis on the unique words that
          an artist uses in their songs. The idea for this comes from a vocabulary analysis of
          Hip Hop artists done by Matt Daniels.

        </p>
        <p>
          To use this simply enter an artist and a song to add the words in the lyrics to the data
          set. Simple token analysis will be done on the words in the lyrics to determine the
          percentage of unique words per artist. As more songs are added from each artist the
          percentage will represent an aggregate of all the songs queried for. The data will then
          be loaded on a D3 bar chart which will graphically represent the percent of unique words
          in all the songs that have been requested. Cards for each artist will be added below the
          chart with more detailed information.
        </p>
        <p>
          <em>A note on uniqueness: The tokens would consider words like don't and do not different.
          Also, slang and purposely misspelled words will be tokenized as unique.</em>

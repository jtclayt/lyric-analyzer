        <h2>About this site</h2>
        <p>
          This website uses the lyrics.ovh API to do some simple analysis on the unique words that
          an artist uses in their songs. The idea for this comes from a vocabulary analysis of
          Hip Hop artists done by Matt Daniels.

        </p>
        <p>
          To use this simply enter an artist and a song to add that set of lyrics to the data set.
          Simple token analysis will be done on the words in the lyrics to determine the percentage
          of unique words per artist. As more songs are added from each artist the percentage will
          represent an aggregate of all the songs queried for. The data will then be loaded on a D3
          bar chart which will graphically represent the percent of unique words in all the songs
          that have been requested. Cards for each artist will be added below the chart with more
          detailed information.
